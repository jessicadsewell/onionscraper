# News Scraper

For this assignment, we were required to create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news through a website of our choosing. For my news scraper, I chose to use *The Onion*. For scraping specifically, I used mongoose and cheerio.

Other languages/styling used were: express, bootstrap, mongoose, MongoDB, axios and node.js. 

**Using the site**

To scrape articles initially from the site, the user will select the "Scrape New Articles" button. This will grab articles directly from The Onion website and display them on the page with a title and link. The user will have the option of following the link, clearing articles or saving an article to read for later.

If the user selects "Save", the article will be added to the *Saved Articles* tab located on the NavBar. 

In the Saved Articles window, a list of saved articles will display. Once these are displayed, the user can add article notes, view all articles notes and remove the article from saved. They will also be able to delete notes, if needed.

Enjoy!
